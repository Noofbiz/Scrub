# Building
If you can get [engo](https://engoengine.github.io/) running, you 
should be able to build it yourself. 
[gomobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile) is required to build 
for iOS and Android.

# Assets
The assets are not hosted on this repo. Instead, I'll post links 
here where you can download the assets yourself.

The background tiles are all from 
[Kenney's Topdown Shooter Asset Pack](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/topdown-shooter)
After you download that, put the file 
`topdown-shooter/Spritesheet/spritesheet_tiles.png` into the assets 
folder.

The dust bunnies, scrubber, and other assets are done by me, and can
be found 
[here](https://www.skeleboystudios.com/assets/scrub/characters.png).
